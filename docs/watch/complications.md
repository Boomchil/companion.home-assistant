Complications allow you to show additional information on your watch faces. All sensor and entity information available in Home Assistant (with the exception of camera feeds or other non-textual data) can be displayed through complications. There are **many** possible types of complications across the different types of watch faces. This page attempts to cover all of these and show how to set them up.
