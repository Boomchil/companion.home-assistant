Home Assistant has deep integration with the Apple Watch. You can display Home Assistant information as complications directly on your watch face or launch actions from the Watch app.

> Note: The Apple Watch integration requires watchOS 5. In order to install watchOS 5 you must have an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 12 or later, and an Apple Watch Series 1 through 4. The first-generation Series 0 Apple Watch is not compatible with watchOS 5. You can identify your Apple Watch model [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204507).
